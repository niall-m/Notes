  * For our purposes we will ignore any IAM usage
  * IAM allows teams of developers to use the same AWS account, with separate privileges, configured by an admin
  * IAM also allows you to create roles that are not intended for use by humans, but for API usage
* API, Tokens & CLI
  * AWS API requires you to authenticate via 2 tokens:
    * aws_access_key_id
    * aws_secret_access_key
