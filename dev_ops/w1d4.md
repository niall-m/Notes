## W1D4 Databases

SQL Relational Databases
* Amazon Aurora
* MySQL
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server

RDS - AWS Relational Database management

Relational Databases
* Data is stored in tables
* Tables stored as rows and columns
* Underlying data-structure is typically a BST or Array (fixed fields)
  * BST added if there is an index
* Queries (searching) is typically performed via SQL
* Able to relate different tables
* Able to provide different ways to "Key" the BST
* "Primary Key" is typically disk represented
* Able to provide additional "indexes" to increase search speed

* explain analyze (before sql query)
  * ex: explain analyze select * from users (etc.)

### Indexes
Indexes tell the database to also represent the table in a secondary BST (or hash), with keys only, values pointing to the original record. When querying, the database will try to use the best index available.

### WAYS TO MAKE DB BETTER/FASTER
1. Indexes
2. Scaling
  * Read Replicas (master/slave)
  * Sharding
    * Vertical Sharding (microservices)
    * Horizontal Sharding (DB per client)

Read Replica
* Master/Slave model
  * Master is read write
  * Slaves are read only, copies of Master
  * Slaves used for large reads & backup

Vertical Sharding
  * Separate tables that don't relate to each other (with joins) to individual databases / microservices
Horizontal Sharding
  * think Slack

**LOOKUP**: ACIDity
  * Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
