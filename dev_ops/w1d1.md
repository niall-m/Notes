## W1D1

<!-- Standard Production Stack -->

define process:
* allows you to do multiple things concurrently

Processes - OS
This OS is responsible for:
  * Allow multiple processes to run "simultaneously"
    * Context Switching
  * Restrict processes based on user permissions
  * Allow these processes to share resources:
    * RAM (memory) with "colliding"
    * Hard drive access, according to user permissions
    * Network usage - Ports
    * Other devices
 
different than CPU cycle:
  * fetch command from memory
  * decode command
  * execute command
  * store result back in memory

Process - A Single process
* Each process has its own ID (PID - process ID)
* Programs you write are typically "interpreted"
* Alternatively, "compiled" programs are usually written in C (or C++)
* A program written in C has to make system calls (eg. malloc) to interact with system resources
* *System calls* are functions that the operating system is required to provide in the C language (glibc)

Processes - As a tree
* processes have a parent process
  * ultimate parent process is the kernel

* sudo ps aux
OR
* brew install pstree
* pstree

Processes - Interaction
* System Calls to access resources
* Environment Variables are static over process lifetime
* Stdin, Stdout, Stderr are ways to accept text input from a keyboard, and write text output to a screen
* Signals are ways for outside processes to trigger your process, similar to an event listener
  * ex: ctrl-c to kill process -- sig int (interrupt), allows signal handler to do something before program ends
  * ex: ctrl-d completely kills process
* Optionally, the process can ask the OS for access to the networking interface, which will assign a port number to your process

CHECK THIS OUT: **OSI Stack**
* 7 layers to the OSI stack
  * physical layer
  * etc.
  * Network Layer

Network Layer / Networking - Sockets
* *gives you IP Addresses*
* Each process can open 1 or more ports
* Ports determine which process will receive an inbound packet
* Ports are either TCP or UDP
* Each network device has a MAC address
* Any connected device also has an IP address
  * wireless router GIVES that connected device an IP address

Private Network
* Private networks have reserved ip addresses: 192.168.?.? or 10.?.?.?
* Lookup Network Address Traversal (NAT) -- how router knows when to send info to one device vs another

**IP Address is hierarchical**
**Port #'s are important**

Domain name - hierarchical in nature
**Networking - DNS**
DNS maps a human readable domain to an IP address
* DNS is a global directory
* DNS is hierarchical
* Domains can have subdomains as children
* The root of this tree are the 13 root-servers
* Multiple domains may map to the same IP address
* Per DNS request, only 1 IP response

* https://www.appacademy.io/immersive/courses
* <protocol>://<subdomains>.<domain>/<path>
* doesn't have a port #, https assums port 443

**Full** url
* postgres://myuser:mypass@db.coolsite.com:5432/mydb
* <protocol>://<user>:<password>@<subdomains>.<domain>:<port>/<path>

SUMMARY
* All code is executed as a process
* Processes have multiple ways to communicate with their environment, including **environment variables**
* We use **networking** in our processes to allow external communication
* Our process can be allocated a **port**
* An **IP address** allows us to address a specific computer in a network
* Combining IP and Port we can make 2 processes communicate with each other
* etc.... check slides

Scaling a web application
* The goal of scaling is to serve more traffic by adding more hardware
* Linear scaling is desirable (2x machines = 2x traffic processed)
* Databases are hardest to scale
* How to scale:
  * Break stack into individual process groups
  * Dedicate machine to only one process group
  * Analyze and track the resources of that process
  * Minimize the amount of resources on the machine as necessary to decrease cost
  * Scale horizontally by adding more machines
* To scale effectively, the load has to be shared evenly across the available servers
* Statelessness between requests makes it easier to scale

in other words... **break up app into as small pieces as possible**

The Stack
* User's Browser => Internet => OS [WS Interface [Web Application [DB]]]

Application Servers
* This is the backend code that you write
* Runs inside an WS interface (RACK, WSGI, CGI, etc)
  * WS == web server interface -- i.e. Rack communicating with Rails
* Typically will be multi-threaded/multi-process
* Silo'ed with a shared DB
* Monolithic vs Microservices
* Horizontally Scalable
* Least often the bottleneck, but may be CPU/Memory bound

Web Servers
* Provides a customizable gateway for performing HTTP level actions
* Redirections (e.g. to www. or https)
* Authentication/Authorization
* SSL endpoint
* Performance optimization (timeout)
* Bound by Request Queueing/Threading/Child processes
* May optionally manage the application
* Examples:
  * Nginx
  * Apache

Database
* Typically Master/Slave
* Master is read/write
* Slave is read only, used for large reads, also used for backups
* Master uses transaction log shipping to update slave
* Singular in nature
* Can be a major bottleneck, CPU bound
* Can be optimized by:
  * read/write separation
  * query optimization
  * microservices
  * async
  * sharding -- one table in one DB, another table in another DB

* Load Balancer
  * software load balancer or *hardware* load balancer (AWS uses hardware)
  * Provides a single IP that will forward TCP/HTTP packets to other hosts
  * May provide an SSL service (SSL = secure socket layer)
  * May allow dynamic hosts
  * Very fast
  * On HTTP, will set custom headers (X-forwarded-for)
  * ex:
    * Hardware
    * HAProxy
    * Nginx
    * DNS/GeoDNS

CDN
* works using cache control headers
* makes static content load much much faster
* Specifically HTTP Cache, often used for static assets
* May sit beside or infront of your web server
* Good CDNs are located globally and use geo dns
* Invalidation is very tricky
* China has separate providers
* Proprietary Networks:
  * Akamai
  * Cloudfront
  * ChinaCache
* Technologies:
  * Squid
  * Varnish

Job runner
* Sometimes you'll need to run jobs that are slow and take a long time
* If you do this in a web request it will timeout
* Job runner needs to communicate asynchronously to other processes
* Typically will use a queue
* Scheduled tasks
  * Cron
  * Celery (Django)
  * Resque/Delayed Job

Queues
* Inter-process communication (IPC) made easy
* Inter-machine communication just as easy
* etc..... see slides

**Pieces of the Puzzle**
How to scale your application
* Load Balancers
* Web Server
* Application Server
* Databases
* Queues
* Job runner
* Cache
* CDN

Cache
* Application Cache vs HTTP Cache
* Very fast storage, typically in memory
* Great for storing results to frequent queries
* Invalidation can be a problem
* Memcached
  * Older and larger community source base
  * Simple data types
  * HTTP Cache integration
* Redis
  * More modern, but less robust
  * Complex data types
  * Often hand-rolled solutions

FINAL SUMMARY, WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW...
* Processes often communicate via the network, addressable via a URL
* A production web environment often combines many network services together
* Dedicated hardware per service allows us to customize the machine resources per the services requirements, eliminating wasted resources
* Load balancers allows traffic to
* etc....
