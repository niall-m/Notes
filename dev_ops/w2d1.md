'node' variable: refers to giant custom attributes json document

'service' variable: refers to long lasting process of some kind

###### Cookbook Setup & Berkshelf

* Berkshelf is a public cookbook repository
* We list our dependencies in metadata.rb and install with "berks vendor <path>"
* etc.
* Attributes are passed in via Opsworks... etc.

###### setup.rb - Included Recipes
* These 6 included lines are used to run recipes in other cookbooks
  * include_recipe "ruby-ng::dev"
  * include_recipe "nodejs"
  * include_recipe "nodejs::npm"
  * include_recipe "postgres"
    * (client libraries)
  * include_recipe "nginx"
  * include_recipe "unicorn"

###### setup.rb - Init.d Service
* Init.d is a service that enables starting and stopping of a long running application easy

###### setup.rb - unicorn
* We're using Unicorn as our production application server
* Unicorn starts multiple instances of your app, proxies requests to instances, and monitors them for failure
* Unicorn can talk to nginx over unix sockets
* We will create the directories to store our unix socket
* And then place our unicorn config file using the unicorn_config resource

###### deploy.rb

* dependencies
  * We need to install dependencies with:
    * bundle install for gems
    * npm install for node
* If we are serving static assets, we also need to compile both our backend and frontend assets:
  * webpack
  * rake assets:precompile
* If we use a CDN we can avoid these steps

###### metadata.rb
Metadata.rb is similar to package.json
* it contains our cookbook name, description etc.
* It also contains our external cookbook dependencies

###### Berksfile & "berks vendor .."
* The berksfile contains only the location to the public cookbook repo source
* Opsworks does not manage external cookbooks for you, so you have to check them in
* To download the books locally:
  * cd cookbooks/my_cookbook
  * berks vendor ..
