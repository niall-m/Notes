## W2D4 Monitoring

###### Overview
* System Monitoring
* App monitoring
* Custom data monitoring
* Cloudwatch
  * AWS tool
* Notifications

###### System Monitoring
* Different services require different amount of resources
* Databases
  * CPU
* Web Servers
  * Response Time
  * Request Queueing
* Job runners
  * Possibly CPU
  * Possibly RAM
* Caches & Queues
  * RAM
* Benchmarking Tools
  * Apache Bench
  * Benchmarking === how many requests can my system handle
* Open source software:
  * Nagios
  * Ganglia
  * Zenoss
* AWS
  * Cloudwatch

###### App Monotoring (APM)
* Tracking of common web frameworks allows for greater insights
* For example Rails:
  * Track model queries
  * Track timing at different layers (MVC)
  * Track users
* Code level analysis
* Application error tracking
* Saas Services
  * New Relic
    * best monitoring service, expensive
    * can get deep in Rails, Django, Express, etc.
  * Datadog
  * Rolibar

###### Custom Data Monitoring
* Often there are business level metrics that you may want to track
  * Click through rates
  * Total sales
* Or sometimes developer level metrics:
  * Server processing rate
  * Internal queue lengths
  * Other timing metrics
* Many APM services offer custom metrics tracking
* As do many system monitors
* Open Source
  * StadsD

###### Cloudwatch
* Cloudwatch is AWS's monitoring software
* Tightly integrated with system metrics from ec2
* Weak on APM
* Provides custom metrics
* Customizable "Alarms"
* Trigger email (or other)

###### Aside -- CPU Cycle
* CPU Cycle: Fetch => Decode => Execute => Store
* Fetch (RAM)
* Decode (control unit)
* Execute (arithmetic / logic unit)
* Store (RAM)

###### Notifications
* Many software engineering teams will have members on-call for technical support
* On-call staff won't check email while asleep
* Phone services (Voice & Text) help them wake up
* Services:
  * Pagerduty
    * standard
  * Twilio
  * Google Voice
* Who watches the watcher?
  * i.e. what happens when the monitoring system goes down
