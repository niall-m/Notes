## W1D5 Puppet, Chef & Opsworks

###### Overview
* Fleet management
* Puppet vs Chef (ruby)
* Ansible vs SaltStack (python)
* Opsworks
  * AWS version
  * Uses Puppet & Chef

Deploying to a large fleet - Series

Issues & Concerns
* Downtime is always a concern, so speed is desired
* We want all machines to be in a known state at all times
* Deployment scripts are comprised of multiple steps
* Failure of a single step can cause the machine to be in an unknown state
* Failures can occur from:
  * Bugs in scripts
  * Network Issues
  * Version Locking Issues
  * Resource Inconsistencies
* We can mitigate risks by:
  * Minimizing network distance
  * Automating as much as possible
  * Idempotency with rollback

Deployment Strategies - Cutover
* Manager
  * Server that runs puppet or chef
  * Scripts trigger the Manager
  * Manager does the work for you and reports back to the user

Pilot

Parallel
  * Testing with real users in the wild, only a subset of servers
  * Half of the machines get updated
  * Switch and update the other half
  * No downtime

Other Concerns
* Database Migrations
  * one solution is to get central manager to do the migration
* Load Balancing
* A/B testing
* Push vs Pull
* Multiple server roles with multiple environments

#### Puppet
* Puppet scripts define the "final state" of the server
* Each "step" in the script is modeled as a "resource"
* Each resource can be dependent on other resources
* Puppet makes a graph of changes to apply based on deps
* Each resource type has the ability to compare the current state to the desired state
* Each resource type also has the ability to modify the server's state, to deploy or rollback
* Puppet server communicates bi-directionally with puppet agents on the machines
* Can be run in solo mode
* Ruby (DSL -- domain specific language)

#### Chef
* Chef "recipes" define "repeatable steps" to get a server into a desired state
* Recipes are combined into cookbooks (pluggable)
* Each "step" in the script is modeled as a "resource"
* Each resource is intended to be parameterized and idempotent
* Rollback is then just redeployed with previous params
* Chef server communicates bi-directionally with chef agents on the machines
* Can be run in solo mode
* Ruby (DSL)

#### Ansible
* Connects to your nodes and pushes out small programs, called "Ansible modules"
* Parallel
* Modules are models of the desired state of the system
* Ansible executes these modules (Over SSH by default), and removes them when finished
* No servers, daemons, or databases
* Python

#### SaltStack
* Client/Server model, similar to Puppet and Chef
* Parallel or series
* Plugin system
* SLS scripts
* Python

#### Opsworks
* AWS service
* Uses client/server model
* Uses custom server and custom client agent
* Uses either puppet or chef scripts
* Therefore uses puppet/chef in solo mode
* Integrates with lifecycle of AWS EC2 Instances

###### Opsworks Units
* Stacks
  * Group machines together based on shared resources
* Layers
  * Group machines together based on roles
  * Custom recipes per lifecycle event
* Apps
  * Deployable identifier, scripts can use app name

###### Custom JSON
Opsworks (and Chef) use a json configuration scheme to apply Chef Attributes:
* Stack level
  * Overwritten by Layer level
  * Overwritten by Deployment activity
Chef internally uses a similar override scheme in its recipes:
* default
* force_default
* normal
* override
* force_override
* automatic
