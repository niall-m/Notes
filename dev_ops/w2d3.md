## W2D3 CDN Integration

###### Overview
* Cache
* HTTP Req/Resp
* CDNs
* Cache control/expiry
* Cache validation & vary
* Cloudfront

###### Cache
* Application Cache vs HTTP Cache
* Very fast storage, typically in memory
* Great for storing results to frequent queries
* Invalidation can be a problem
* Memcached
  * Older and larger community source base
  * Simple data types
  * HTTP Cache integration
* Redis
  * More modern, but less robust
  * Complex data types
  * Often hand-rolled solutions

4 types of databases
* Key-value database (Redis, caching, giant hash table on disk)
* Relational database (SQL databases, can do joins)
* Document database (no joins)
* Graph database (adjacency list graph on disk)

### HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Typically available on port 80
* Ascii/UTF8 data format
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231

###### Request
* GET /doc/test.html HTTP/1.1
* Host: www.test101.com
* Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
* Accept-language: en-us
* Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
* User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
* Content-Length: 35

###### Response
* HTTP/1.1 200 OK
* Date: Sun, 08 Feb xxxx 01:11:12 GMT
* Server: Apache/1.3.29 (Win32)
* Last-Modified: Sat, 07 Feb xxxx
* ETag: "0-23-4024c3g5"
* Accept-Ranges: bytes
* Content-Length: 35
* Connection: close
* Content-Type: text/html

### CDNs
* Spatially located proximal to large populations
* Less hops, less delays
* Typically backed by an application
  * If CDN doesn't have the requested file in cache, get it from the application server
* Uses http cache headers to decide how long to keep the file in cache
* Some provide invalidation via API
* Building your own is hard, best to use:
  * Akamai
  * Cloudfront
    * We will use this, backed by S3
  * Cloudera
  * ChinaCache

### Cache control/expiry - Cache Control
"Cache-Control" http header is used to direct caching rules for any device in the request/response route.
* no-store - do not cache or even store the file in the client
* no-cache - do not cache the file
* public - may be cached by any device (some status codes don't cache by default)
* private - store in browser cache only
* max-age=<seconds> - set maximum cache time
  * ex: Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400
* must-revalidate - use validation headers

###### Cache validation
Cache validation can be configured via a number of different headers.
* Etag - fingerprints the response and returns the hash value
  * If-none-match client header
* Last-Modified - weak validation
  * If-modified-since client header

###### Vary Header
The "vary" header tells any caching device to cache multiple copies based on another given header (the key).
  * ex: Vary: User-agent

###### Cloudfront
  * Cloudfront is the AWS CDN
  * Cloudfront uses Squid under the hood
  * Can use all the previous mentioned headers
  * Can also override http headers
  * Provides "Web" and "RTMP"

### RTMP
  * use for streaming
