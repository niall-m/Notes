## W1D3 Continuous Integration/Deployment

#### Jenkins

note -- Regression testing

CI/CD providers:
  * Codeship
  * Travis CI
  * Salano
  * CircleCI
  * Jenkins
Jenkins is open source, all others are SaaS

Continuous integration:
* Gets triggered by source code commits
* Runs any test for frontend or backend code
* Builds any artifacts (production js files, rails assets)
* Publishes the artifacts (test results to dashboard, or an assets to S3)
* Triggers a deploy (in Opsworks)
* Many CI systems are configured by a config file in the source code repo
* Can build multiple branches and only deploy specific branches to specific environments

Jenkins
* Jenkins is an open source pluggable build workflow manager with a web UI
* Plugins and a public plugin repository allow Jenkins to be integrated with many services
* Projects are configured in workflow stages:
  * Source control
  * Build Steps
  * Post Build Steps
* Each stage of the workflow can impact the next step (e.g. on failure)
* Project can be configured to trigger each other
* The web UI shows a dashboard that can visualize build status, as well as test results

Jenkins Plugins
  * Jenkins plugins allow you to write custom source control integrations, build steps or post build steps
  * etc...

Jenkins - Source Control
  * Jenkins can integrate with many different source control systems
  * Traditional source control system would just poll on a regular basis
  * Github uses web hooks (http requests)

Build Steps
  * Run Tests
  * Build Production assets
  * Publish Assets to S3
  * Deploy via Opsworks
