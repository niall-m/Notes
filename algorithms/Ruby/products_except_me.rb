# Products Except Me

# Given an array of numbers, return an array of all the products remaining when each element is removed from the array.
# You may wish to write a helper method: array_product.

#   12 because you take out 2, leaving 3 * 4
#   8, because you take out 3, leaving 2 * 4
#   6, because you take out 4, leaving 2 * 3

#   30 because you take out 1, leaving 2 * 3 * 5
