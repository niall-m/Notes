## React Native Redux Udemy course notes

To create a new project, navigate to parent directory in terminal and use command: react-native init project_name

to run the app in emulator: react-native run-ios (or run-android)

Redux has lot of confusing terminology, but very straightforward concepts
* Reducer: a function that returns some data
* Action: an object that tells that tells the reducer how to change its data; only requirement is that it has a ‘type’ property
* State: data for our app to use
* Store: an object that holds the applications data
